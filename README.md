## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

### Connectivity's effect on school from home.

* What can the correlation between internet connectivity/speed and school performance over past years tell us about the effect of internet speed/connectivity on ability to learn now?

----

* The Covid-19 pandemic has recently made even clearer the importance of an internet connection in ability to learn. Especially with the themes of 2020 and the importance of education on social mobility and change, can we create a predictive model, based on past data, to show how internet connectivity effects education. This will have to make use of education statistics at a fairly granular level as well as any available data points of internet connectivity.
